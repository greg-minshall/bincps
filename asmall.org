* A small contribution to income inequality analysis

** Introduction

in a [[https://twitter.com/kltblom/status/932394678241988609][Tweet]] from 19 November, 2017, Kristian Blom showed [[file:./DPCIA2AUQAEO0lv.jpg][a histogram]]
(1971-2015), from Financial Times (based on data from Pew Trust).
Blom asked, given that the past forty-plus years has seen *everyone*
do better, should we be worried about the growing inequality?

Blom showed the following graphic, apparently from a video from the
Financial Times.

While Blom's question was asking for a qualitative answer, here I
treat the question technically.

** The data

For me, i felt the need to see the data as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function][CDF]] to really understand
what was going on.  Using data from [[http://www.ipums.org][IPUMS-CS]], I was able to create the
following graphic:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports results :results silent
    (defmacro ext (base)
      (format "%s.%s" base
              (if (and (boundp 'backend) (equal backend 'html)) "png" "pdf")))
#+end_src

environment, and my thanks to the team that develops R:

Third, my approach to anything statistical is indebted to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey][John Tukey]]'s
/Exploratory Data Analysis/, a book i highly recommend.
