* A small contribution to income inequality analysis

in a [[https://twitter.com/kltblom/status/932394678241988609][Tweet]] from 19 November, 2017, Kristian Blom showed [[file:./DPCIA2AUQAEO0lv.jpg][a histogram]]
(1971-2015), from Financial Times (based on data from Pew Trust).
Blom asked, given that the past forty-plus years has seen *everyone*
do better, should we be worried about the growing inequality?

While Blom's question was asking for a qualitative answer, here I
treat the question technically.

Blom showed the following graphic, apparently from a video from the
Financial Times.

For me, i felt the need to see the data as a CDF to really understand
what was going on.  this led to a quest to find appropriate data (for
the US).
