* A small contribution to income inequality analysis

** meta :noexport:

the following takes (what should be links ending in) strings that end
in ".IMG" and changes them to end in either ".pdf" or ".png",
depending on whether the current export is to latex or html.

this is definitely a sledge hammer approach.  there are other
techniques that seem promising, in particular using org-mode's
'#+BIND' keyword with org-export-filter-link-functions, but i was
unable to make that work.

this code runs as org-mode starts to export, and changes everything
under the sun.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports results :results none
  (defun get-image-names (backend)
    (let ((rment (if (equal backend 'html) ".png" ".pdf"))
          (case-fold-search nil))
      (while (re-search-forward "[.]IMG\\>" nil t)
        (replace-match rment t))))
  (add-hook 'org-export-before-parsing-hook 'get-image-names)

** Introduction

in a [[https://twitter.com/kltblom/status/932394678241988609][Tweet]] from 19 November, 2017, Kristian Blom showed [[file:./DPCIA2AUQAEO0lv.jpg][a histogram]]
(1971-2015), from Financial Times (based on data from Pew Trust).
Blom asked, given that the past forty-plus years has seen *everyone*
do better, should we be worried about the growing inequality?

Blom showed the following graphic, apparently from a video from the
Financial Times.

While Blom's question was asking for a qualitative answer, here I
treat the question technically.

** The data

For me, i felt the need to see the data as a (empirical) cumulative
function ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function][CDF]]) to really understand what was going on.  Using data
from [[http://www.ipums.org][IPUMS-CS]], I was able to create the following graphic (which is
presented in 1999 dollars, not the2014 dollars of the FT graph):

[[file:replot.IMG]]

This is not by any means exactly as the FT graphic Blom tweeted.
However, if you squint, it is roughly the same.

If you will grant me that the two graphs represent the same
distribution of household incomes, then we can now look at the CDF of
the dataset underlying the second graphic:

[[file:ecdf.IMG]]

In the above, we see that about 30% of US households have done better
in the years since 1972.  If we blow up the section for household
incomes below $50,000, we can see what happens around that area in
more detail:

[[file:ecdf2.IMG]]

Here it becomes clearer that for somewhat more than one quarter of US
households, the years since 1972 have not improved their economic lot,
have, in fact, made their economic situation worse.


** Caveats

I have been lazy.  When I say a year (1972, say), above, I mean the
report the Census Bureau issued in that year which, in fact, reports
on data collected on the previous year (1971, say).

** Appendices
*** CDF
*** High income issues

not enough data points?  Piketty, Saez, et al.

*** Low income issues

low income quality of life may be highly influenced by social "safety
net" (welfare) programs.  so, loss of N% over 40 years may not
translate to an N% lower quality of life.

*** Most reported incomes

*** Who gets what percent of the national income?

A lot of money is paid out in income in the United States.  How is
this money distributed among the various income groups?  Here is a CDF
which shows what percent of the total national income is paid out to
which income groups in the US.
